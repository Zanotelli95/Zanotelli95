### Entrepreneur - Engineer ðŸ‘‹

Hi! IÂ´m FabiÃ¡n Zanotelli. Mi first touch in software development and technology was in middle and high school, then in university i study por almost 2 years systems engineering, but for life reasons i had to start to work in a gym and change my career to bussines managment's engineering, but i never forget technology. I graduated in bussines managmentÂ´s engineering and then i started to investment in Bitcoin, this allowed me continue to learn programming skills for my own and traveling a little too. Later on i started to create my first fitness app Korellia Club and then started to learn more programming skills.
